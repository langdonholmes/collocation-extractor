# colextractor

This is a simple hack of [spaCy](https://spacy.io) streamlit. It rewrites some of the dependency visualizer code to display a subset of dependencies, rather than the full dependency tree. Also included is some code for calculating measures of association strength (on bigrams, dependency bigrams, or 'collocation candidates').


# spacy-streamlit

This package contains utilities for visualizing [spaCy](https://spacy.io) models
and building interactive spaCy-powered apps with
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). It includes various building blocks you can
use in your own Streamlit app, like visualizers for **syntactic dependencies**,
**named entities**, **text classification**, **semantic similarity** via word
vectors, token attributes, and more.
